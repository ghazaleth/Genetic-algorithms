# Genetic-algorithms
Using Genetic algorithms method in Matlab.
This example illustrates how to perform an optimization using the AGs technique in the
Matlab environment. To do this, make the following steps:

1- Create a file.m to define the objective function, as follows:

2- Launch the AGs tool, as follows: type in Command Window:

> [!NOTE]
> The new versions of Matlab doesn't support (gatool) so try (optimtool) instead.

3- Insert the name of the objective function in the field: Fitness function: ```@objfun```

and the name of 'solver' we choose (ga genetic algorithm)

Insert the number of variables in the field: Number of variables: 2

Insert the variable variation interval (min and max) in the fields: Lower : [-5.12 -5.12]
and Upper : [5.12 5.12]
